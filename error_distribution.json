bacon to your eggs cheese is included and condiments of sour cream and salsa are provided You also get a potato side reds or browns Huge portion tortillas were overflowing removed over half the filling before I could even pick up the tacos to eat properly not a complaint and the corn tortillas held up so well that I was able to stick to a single layer and used the extras to make additional

incarnation leaves something to be desired Located in a rentedout strip mall in a seedy part of Bell Avenue 13th Floor does not impress you from the getgo What you do notice right away is the crowd of hundreds of people lined up to get inside and get spooked I took this as a good sign even though we showed up half an hour after they opened Buy your tickets online if you can There is a line of hundreds to get in the house and a similar line for tickets as well If youre a patient person and you want some time to build up the anticipation and adrenaline by being surrounded by a ton of giddy and jumpy people go for the lines They have actors with chainsaws and creepy makeup pacing around scaring the easy targets posing for pictures and giving you a preview of whats to come The actual haunted house is nothing special If youve been to one before youll see it all again You have actors in creepy makeup and clothing jumping out at you slamming things against the wall or floor and getting up in your face There are rooms youre led through themed as grisly defiled homes kitchens and hallways there was a piratethemed area and a misty jungle to walk through I was disappointed in the lack of jumps in that area the scare potential among the closepressing fog bushes and trees was great I wish I had been able to go through more slowly to admire the props and background setup everything was something youve seen before but it was beautifully set up 13th Floor may not have scared me but they get points for attention to detail One thing that Ill admit Ive never seen before was the usage of partially closed garage doors placed in strategic areas Open only a foot or two from the floor an actor would get a running start and slide on his knees out from under the door and then pop up next to you The first time or two I saw this it was downright hilarious this does not seem to be an easy or very practiced thing for the actors to do and some of them ate it or slammed into my legs like they were trying to take me out The actors are not supposed toallowed to touch you I will admit that Im not an easy person to scare Im not jumpy or unnerved by the dark loud sounds or people lunging at my face suddenly When you take care of a toddler all day you develop a sort of Clint Eastwood hardness and eventually lose your flinching reflex There were however people all around me screaming their heads off in terror One girl was even sobbing If that isnt a testament to 13th Floors fear factor I dont know what is The fatal flaw of my visit was the fact that the event staff was not separating the groups for long enough time periods Things cease to be scary when youre basically part of a continuous shuffling line of people Youre rushed and you can see ahead of you

get a VIP ticket which gives you access to a much shorter line regular admission is 25 Had I paid half that amount I would have written this off as an unusual fun activity to try out on a Saturday

marinara It was fried Calamari Luckily though it was not soggy or gross It was fried up nicely and with a spritz of lemon and a bit of the sauce was a decent app Spinach Artichoke Al Forno I am a fan of artichokes in apps My favorite though it basically just grilling the artichoke and serving it to me as is However I was not impressed with this dip It is baked in an Asiago and Alfedolike cheese sauce and it just did not have any zing to make it any better than any other spinach dip I have had Crab Shrimp Cannelloni 1850 Ugh What a waste of money This dish came out in a POOL of cheese sauce Literally the entire plate was cheese sauce The menu description says this Asiago cheese sauce and breadcrumbs No There were no breadcrumbs My plate was a goopy pile of cheese sauce with three lone Cannellonis that had perhaps 45 pieces of shrimp The peppers included did not enhance the meal one bit The cannelloni was soggy and unappetizing and the crab meat inside was like a wet mop just

customers addressing the manager about the poor selection and some items being out for over 45 mins The manager apologized to the people complaining and said they had a few new trainees in the kitchen and they couldnt keep up with the crowd that night We returned to our seats and the meat service started They seemed to mostly only have sirloin steak and a roast like cut of beef we asked about filet mignon and we were told they didnt have it The also had a grilled ham chicken lamb and other pork items We asked for our meat to be medium well so we were served our meat on a saucer they brought from the back with about 3 thinly sliced pieces of meat instead of it being carved at the table Pros of the visit were the saut\u00e9ed mushrooms on the salad bar the grilled pineapples which were

another chance since it was so busy that evening Maybe a week later I went back to try the Chicken Wing Sliders unfortunately they got my order wrong again but this time I was in a rush and just ate the sliders They were good not great The main issue I have with them is that they have a wonderbread type bun Just empty whitebread carbs that basically taste like nothingness and if youre paying around 15 for sliders I would hope to have something a bit better Ive been a few other times and have had salads which are decent and also they make an excellent Caesar which have little pepperonis as

waitress who never even refilled our water glasses though she did check in to see that our food had arrived okay The fish tacos were disappointing to say the least The fish itself had been fried in a crispy but flavorless batter The majority of the real estate on the three flour tortillas though was occupied by lettuce tomatoes and a few strands of cheese Lemon wedges rounded out the plate The

that so no biggie 4 Room smells like cigarette and febreeze but the smell goes away when the AC is on 5 Pubic hair inside the hot tub 6 Dust all over counters and tables 7 Wall plugs are loose so if you charge your phone or plug something in make sure the plug does not fall out of the wall 8 Front door to hotel room does not close all the way it locks shut but there is a large gap between the door frame and door 9 Toilet paper in the room was halfway used when we checked in 10 Carpet on floor is ripped 11 NO dressers on room so your living out of your suitcase until you leave 12 Entry gates from parking do not work or open so you have to park on one side of the property just to get to the opposite side When we informed hotel staff the gate isnt working they just said it acts weird and its every other gate that works 13 Ants all over the outdoor ice machine 14 Parking is kind of sketchy no lighting behind the building bunch of homeless people hanging out in that area 15 Shower head hangs on the ceiling forcing you to get your hair wet also making it awkward to get a good clean PROS 1 The mattresses are comfortable 2 Tvs are nice and clear 3 AC works great", "predicted": 0,

not so much I tried the chocolate carrot lemon and caramel So here is the breakdown on the little cakes 1 The chocolate is duh chocolate cake with a chocolateraspberry mouse filling and topped with ganache The cake was dark like chocolate but pretty dull in flavor The filling was there but not discernable enough to stand out as a flavor unto itself And the ganache was more like dry chocolaty icing IMO not really worth the calories 2 The caramel is a butter cake think yellow filled with caramel mouse and topped with a light caramel frosting The cake was a pretty standard yellow cake The filling was again so mild in flavor that there really wasnt much point in its being there The frosting described as mildly flavored was more of an understatement I really think it was white frosting with a light glazing of caramel underneath IMO really not worth the calories or the price 3The carrot is filled with cream cheese mouse and topped with cream cheese frosting At least this one resembled its description but I wasnt blown away 4 The lemon is a lemon cake filled with lemon chiffon and topped with lemon frosting This was the closest thing to decent in the half dozen that I took home I couldnt detect any lemon in the cake but the filling almost had a hint of tartness and the frosting actually had some zest mixed in which is what I would expect I will definitely support Sweet

server rushed us to get drink orders in but I asked for time since we were sharing the one cocktailwine menu among the table I had to remind the server about my drink order and waited an additional 15 minutes for my glass of wine to arrive We ordered the meat cheese and pickle tray as well as pretzel brioche for appetizers The pretzel brioche and whipped butters were good but no one ever told us what the butters were We figured out one was mustard one honey and the one in the middle was a mystery butter There were very few pickles on our plate one slice of jalapeno for example and we had to ask for more bread In addition I didnt like two of the three cheeses that were served and I cant say that has ever happened to me before Our friends ordered two entrees to share scallops and lamb and the server left before taking the order for the other half of the table We had to call our server back to order My boyfriend and I shared the sticky pork shank and sides of brussel sprouts and crispy fingerling potatoes I enjoyed the pork shank more than my boyfriend did and the brussel sprouts were not crispy like I would have preferred All in all we could have prepared a better version of this meal at home If the food was amazing and the service lackluster I may have been able to overlook the deficits of this restaurant However when a shared meal costs over a hundred dollars in Charlotte no less I expect the food to wow me and the service to be up to standard As a former server in a Michelin star restaurant I know what level of service to expect and what is unacceptable For example when

two freshest seated tables then got served and then the server who frankly had the table manner of a truckstop waitress with her jokes and comments and style of talking about the place she was working apologized for the amount of rice but that they had gotten the last of it By that I assumed she meant that the serving in the pot was shy of a full serving of rice but then the manager came out about an hour into our wait so it was around 830pm and apologized for the lateness and the few minutes delay in the order printing The couple that was there before us that had not been served were also told as were we that our meal would be half priced By almost 9pm we still had only had two baskets of cracker bread and a couple of drink refills Dr Pepper and Indian Chai for my wife When food finally came out for the couple that had been seated before us they were told there is no more rice sorry but we did not expect to get slammed like this Meanwhile of course both my wife and I realized that our dishes would also be best served with Rice and an hour and a half into our experience that was not going to be the case Any longer and we were going to be late for our 930 movie so we left a 5 on the table and left While we watched through the window there were several tables that had been seated after us inside that were already eating so while several of us had a horrible experience that night it is no doubt also true that many people had a flawless night at the same restaurant I guess timing is everything and I really am not sure if I ever want to give them a second shot but might

were the last to be fed pretty much Id recommend sitting closer to the center and avoid the ends of the arena unless you really want to cheer for a certain country in that area Over all the show was

asked for more toasted bread and about 10 minutes later we got 4 more pieces There were 5 of us An appetizer that is over 9 should be able to feed more than 3 people They were also out of anything

dulldrysaucelook on foods Yep So what did I try The mushroom truffle soup salty and creamy it was alright if you like those flavors The clam chowder was alright not as bad as I thought But nowhere near as good as the clam chowders from San Francisco not a fair comparison as Vegas is in the desert and SF is by the bay I noticed that no one touched the salads on their plates so I didnt go there either Boy it sounds like I tried a lot of nothing But I actually tried 4 plates worth of food But nothing really stood out Oh yeah the seafood paella looked great And it was actually just GOOD not great You know what they had a lot of 4 different pizzas cheese pepperoni mushroom and deluxe style But who wants to eat pizza for this price And they had lots of sauces and salsa for the Mexican cuisine station16 sauces and salsa Cmon Who is going to waste stomach space on salsa and chips However you can the chefs to make you fresh tacos which were ok If you like street tacos youll like these I read they have 20 different breads to choose from Only five to choose from and they were stale A small island for desserts Now I admit I dont have much of a sweet tooth so the desserts were mediocre The chocolate lava cake was probably the best thing there it was piping hot and oozing when I broke into it Nothing special about the gelato and Im a huge gelato fan Only the lemon sorbet was palatable Tried the pistachio raspberry and mango also meh So is this buffet worth the high price tag Not in my book But Im glad I tried it so I can say that it was alright The price should actually be 10 cheaper Thats what I think this buffet is worth", "predicted": 0, "actual": 2}, {"input": "We ended up going here when we were looking for a quick breakfast one morning We had actually planned

once I finally became stable had a decent amount of time under my belt w the medication and was moving along nicely I called to ask for a refill of my medication but was denied because I didnt make a

enjoyable Unfortunately that evening my husband was held up at work and we were about an half an hour later than our reservation The host at the restaurant did a wonderful job seating our party and starting the meal as we had texted the family explaining our situation Even upon our arrival the servers were very helpful in getting my husband and me seated As the meats were circulated to our table my husband and I had to continually catch the servers attention Being a slightly larger party of eight I did not think that was a number that would allow members to be overlooked After about 45 minutes it seems the font of house manager noticed our issue and was very helpful sending servers to us and even asking if we were waiting for something particular But due to our later arrival as the rest of our party were enjoying conversation and the market bar the meat stopped arriving along with all servers They all seemed to have migrated to a different portion of the restaurant The other issue I had with the evening was that all the meat except the steak was very dry and over cooked As our reservation was at 6pm I cant imagine this was because the meat had cooked too long during service It was a Thursday evening with Im sure slower traffic than a weekend but I would have thought the kitchen would be aware of how many reservations and on average how much of which dishes move during an evening and would adjust accordingly Sadly to say that does not seem to be the case as chicken pork and even sausage were all dry and over cooked The bottom line is that I left an all you

appeared to be knife marks in walls They made this right by giving us an upgraded apartment We got moved in all seemed to be ok Well the first rain came and that all changedSee the posted photos The ceiling leaked causing what we called our ceiling zit They fixed the roof but not the ceiling right away Next rain it happened again So they came back out and supposedly fixed the roof again Some time later they had a gentleman come out and make the repairs to the inside and he did a great job except he didnt paint the wall and it remained that way until we moved out Called the police once for some crackhead and her boyfriend that were blowing weed smoke into her sons face The son was about 45 years old They finally evicted them They did a facelift on the apartment complex which was just polishing a turd One of the things they did was to change out all light bulbs and in doing so the new kitchen fixture was smaller than the previous one Not horrible but you could see up into the roof

is where it all goes south We have two cats We paid the pet deposit We paid the monthly pet rent Upon move out we cleaned we mopped and we had carpets cleaned I was asked by maintenance days before move out if there was anything wrong with the apartment I told the gentleman everything that was wrong and he said its all good and dont worry about anything The woman that did the final walkthru was shocked at how clean the apartment was and that it didnt even look like we lived there that long at this point I was under the assumption that we would receive more than 50 of our deposit back Well I

me and brought the bill was the owner or manager but he was far more helpful and friendly than our waitress who never even refilled our water glasses though she did check in to see that our food had arrived okay The fish tacos were disappointing to say the least The fish itself had been fried in a crispy but flavorless batter The majority of the real estate on the three flour tortillas though was occupied by lettuce tomatoes and a few strands of cheese Lemon wedges rounded out the plate The fact that the dish was intended to be served with chips and salsa is duly noted Although we both

comparison to some of their peers however I am still baffled at how this has become the holy grail of sweet treats The one constant between the four flavors that I sampled were that they were at least sort of moist But flavorful meh not so much I tried the chocolate carrot lemon and caramel So here is the breakdown on the little cakes 1 The chocolate is duh chocolate cake with a chocolateraspberry mouse filling and topped with ganache The cake was dark like chocolate but pretty dull in flavor The filling was there but not discernable enough to stand out as a flavor unto itself And the ganache was more like dry chocolaty icing IMO not really worth the calories 2 The caramel is a butter cake think yellow filled with caramel mouse and topped with a light caramel frosting The cake was a pretty standard yellow cake The filling was again so mild in flavor that there really wasnt much point in its being there The frosting described as mildly flavored was more of an understatement I really think it was white frosting with a light glazing of caramel underneath IMO really not worth the calories or the price 3The carrot is filled with cream cheese mouse and topped with cream cheese frosting At least this one resembled its description but I wasnt blown away 4 The lemon is a lemon cake filled with lemon chiffon and topped with lemon frosting This was the closest thing to decent in the half dozen that I took home I couldnt detect any lemon in the cake but the filling almost had a hint of tartness and the frosting actually had some zest mixed in which is what I would expect I

seedy part of Bell Avenue 13th Floor does not impress you from the getgo What you do notice right away is the crowd of hundreds of people lined up to get inside and get spooked I took this as a good sign even though we showed up half an hour after they opened Buy your tickets online if you can There is a line of hundreds to get in the house and a similar line for tickets as well If youre a patient person and you want some time to build up the anticipation and adrenaline by being surrounded by a ton of giddy and jumpy people go for the lines They have actors with chainsaws and creepy makeup pacing around scaring the easy targets posing for pictures and giving you a preview of whats to come The actual haunted house is nothing special If youve been to one before youll see it all again You have actors in creepy makeup and clothing jumping out at you slamming things against the wall or floor and getting up in your face There are rooms youre led through themed as grisly defiled homes kitchens and hallways there was a piratethemed area and a misty jungle to walk through I was disappointed in the lack of jumps in that area the scare potential among the closepressing fog bushes and trees was great I wish I had been able to go through more slowly to admire the props and background setup everything was something youve seen before but it was beautifully set up 13th Floor may not have scared me but they get points for attention to detail One thing that Ill admit Ive never seen before was the usage of partially closed garage doors placed in strategic areas Open only a foot or two from the floor an actor would get a running start and slide on his knees out from under the door and then pop up next to you The first time or two I saw this it was downright hilarious this does not seem to be an easy or very practiced thing for the actors to do and some of them ate it or slammed into my legs like they were trying to take me out The actors are not supposed toallowed to touch you I will admit that Im not an easy person to scare Im not jumpy or unnerved by the dark loud sounds or people lunging at my face suddenly When you take care of a toddler all day you develop a sort of Clint Eastwood hardness and eventually lose your flinching reflex There were however people all around me screaming their heads off in terror One girl was even sobbing If that isnt a testament to 13th Floors fear factor I dont know what is The fatal flaw of my visit was the fact that the event staff was not separating the groups for long enough time periods Things cease to be scary when

pickle tray as well as pretzel brioche for appetizers The pretzel brioche and whipped butters were good but no one ever told us what the butters were We figured out one was mustard one honey and the one in the middle was a mystery butter There were very few pickles on our plate one slice of jalapeno for example and we had to ask for more bread In addition I didnt like two of the three cheeses

cleaning the apartment We found a used qtip in one of the bedrooms There was what appeared to be knife marks in walls They made this right by giving us an upgraded apartment We got moved in all seemed to be ok Well the first rain came and that all changedSee the posted photos The ceiling leaked causing what we called our ceiling zit They fixed the roof but not the ceiling right away Next rain it happened again So they came back out and supposedly fixed the roof again Some time later they had a gentleman come out and make the repairs to the inside and he did a great job except he didnt paint the wall and it remained that way until we moved out Called the police once for some crackhead and her boyfriend that were blowing weed smoke into her sons face The son was about 45 years old They finally evicted them They did a facelift on the apartment complex which was just polishing a turd One of the things they did was to change out all light bulbs and in doing so the new kitchen fixture was smaller than the previous one Not horrible but you could see up into the roof and it just look awful That probably has not been fixed Newest Management not sure of the name These folks seemed to be ok We asked for an extension and it was granted and I am thankful for that This is where it all goes south We have two cats We paid the pet deposit We paid the monthly pet rent Upon move out we cleaned we mopped and we had carpets cleaned I was asked by maintenance days before move out if there was anything wrong with the apartment I told the gentleman everything that was wrong and he said its all good and dont worry about anything The woman that did the final walkthru was shocked at how clean the apartment was and that it didnt even look like we lived there that long at this point I was under the assumption that we would receive more than 50 of our deposit back Well I was proven wrong I was just informed that I was being dinged for 70 for an additional carpet cleaning for pet

a truckstop waitress with her jokes and comments and style of talking about the place she was working apologized for the amount of rice but that they had gotten the last of it By that I assumed she meant that the serving in the pot was shy of a full serving of rice but then the manager came out about an hour into our wait so it was around 830pm and apologized for the lateness and the few minutes delay in the order printing The couple that was there before us that had not been served were also told as were we that our meal would be half priced By almost 9pm we still had only had two baskets of cracker bread and a couple of drink refills Dr Pepper and Indian Chai for my wife When food finally came out for the couple that had been seated before us they were told there is no more rice sorry

not going to be the case Any longer and we were going to be late for our 930 movie so we left a 5 on the table and left While we watched through the window there were several tables that had been

hadnt used his money because I had obviously just swiped my card and entered my info so I then left When I came in today 41515 and was approached rudely by this employee I brought up the charge on my

and a bit of the sauce was a decent app Spinach Artichoke Al Forno I am a fan of artichokes in apps My favorite though it basically just grilling the artichoke and serving it to me as is However I was not impressed with this dip It is baked in an Asiago and Alfedolike cheese sauce and it just did not have any zing to make it any better than any other spinach dip I have had Crab Shrimp Cannelloni 1850 Ugh What a waste of money This dish came out in a POOL of cheese sauce Literally the entire plate was cheese sauce The menu description says this Asiago cheese sauce and breadcrumbs No There were no breadcrumbs My plate was a goopy pile of cheese sauce with three lone Cannellonis that had perhaps 45 pieces of shrimp The peppers included did not enhance the meal one bit The cannelloni was soggy

bit longer than the others getting hens to come out We booked our tickets early we were booking Cirque for the same trip and for those shows its needed and Im sure we were the first to book because we could have sat anywhere We choose front row in the middle of Dragon I was worried about eating so close to horses but that wasnt a problem at all Sitting in the front made great seats be we were the last to be fed pretty much Id recommend sitting closer to the center and avoid the ends of the arena unless you really want to cheer for a certain country in that area Over all the show was pretty cool I didnt understand when booking dragon doesnt do any of the competing in the games and is more of the antagonist That means youre sitting in the bulk of the show with no one to cheer on even in the start As an adult that is ok I took a while to figure out we didnt have a king at all Im not sure how ideal that section is for the kids You do get to cheer for the villain that has pyrotechnics whos pretty awesome a bit later on though so maybe that has extra draw to the kids I like the show Its light hearted and fun with some extra pizzazz Its interactive and you can be a bit silly Its not

helpful in getting my husband and me seated As the meats were circulated to our table my husband and I had to continually catch the servers attention Being a slightly larger party of eight I did not think that was a number that would allow members to be overlooked After about 45 minutes it seems the font of house manager noticed our issue and was very helpful sending servers to us and even asking if we were waiting for something particular But due to our later arrival as the rest of our party were enjoying conversation and the market bar the meat stopped arriving along with all servers They all seemed to have migrated to a different portion of the restaurant The other issue I had with the evening was that all the meat except the steak was very dry and over cooked As our reservation was at 6pm I cant imagine this was because the meat had cooked too long during service It was a Thursday evening with Im sure slower traffic than a weekend but I would have thought the kitchen would be aware of how many reservations and on average how much of which dishes move during an evening and would adjust accordingly Sadly to say that does not seem to be the case as chicken pork and even

and had no problem getting a seat My friends went two weeks ago on a Wednesday evening and the wait was over an hour and half I think the atmosphere is pretty cool Its very different compared to most PGH South Hills eateries There were these huge garage doors that I assume will be opened in the warmer months but it did make it very chilly Im happy I had my coat to wear during lunch The beers were very cool a bit expensive but thats expected The descriptions of the beers were on point I think we tried all but 1 because they didnt have it available I could easily crave some of these beers The food was lacking I think the owners need to focus more on getting the customers substance in their food For example we ordered the cheese platter 14 The platter came with 3 small pieces of toasted bread scattered walnut bits that no one know what to do with a few jumbo olives and some standard cheeses We asked for more toasted bread and about 10 minutes later we got 4 more pieces There were 5 of us An appetizer that is over 9 should be able to feed more than 3 people They were also out of anything pretzel which was a letdown understandable since this is still a new business My pizza was pretty amazing though All of the pizzas sounded delicious the ingredients were very fresh Something that was off was that each additional topping was 2 Its just not worth it here Its really not The rest of the table ordered sandwiches Synopsis nothing to write home about The chips they give you on the side seemed like they were from a bag The ones my boyfriend got seemed like they came from the bottom of the bag When everyone was done eating we all said we could definitely eat more This also goes back to the substance point I made Im not sure if this place wants the customers to leave more room for the beer or not If thats the case then they need to lower the food prices This place needs some time to figure out how to be coolurban while also catering to the area We like to eat a lot I like that they have different options outside of usual wings mozzarella sticks and fried zucchini selection that are a staple of the South Hills but dont cheat us I have high hopes for this place Im

probably sit there He told me itd be a 40 minute wait on a Saturday at10AMI looked around and people seemed to be ordering the chicken and waffles but that seemed like too big of a meal for me It took me around 30ish minutes for a seat to open up at the bar Then like 4 freaking seats opened up after me and nobody sat down ugh I wanted waffles though so I ordered the combo which came with pancakes but you could upgrade to a waffle for a buck I also ordered a bloody mary So after I order they come out with chicken and waffles They messed up on my one order so that super sucked The bartender admitted it and asked if I wanted another bloody mary and itd be on her since they messed up but I declined since Id be too blasted walking back to my hotel The bloody mary was really good but the

smallest Ive ever seen They are about onethird the size they were in the past The fish was cut as thinly as possible in tiny pieces over minuscule amounts of rice The 6 pieces of California roll were also the smallest rolls Ive ever seen Pieces of the avocado were dark and discolored Neither the fish nor the rice tasted fresh the way they did in the past The fish was dry and two of the pieces tasted off Miso soup was hot but was salty broth not one piece of seaweed or tofu to be found The soggy lettuce salad was neither cold nor crisp The tea would not even qualify as lukewarm The staff did not bother to check the temperature before serving it Neither ice nor a lemon slice were offered for the small glass of lukewarm tap water The staff were definitely not busy yet they paid almost no attention to the few customers in the place and were neither as efficient nor as friendly as the servers in the past Total waste of money The Ichiban restaurant chain has over 30 locations are they

than messing around so after a perfunctory pass at the antipasti we had the waiter clear our plates and waited for the meat to begin And waited And waited some more Waiter after waiter walked by us huge spear of meat in hand head down studiously ignoring us We finally managed to flag one down by literally yelling We didnt know what else to do since wed been waiting at least ten minutes for somebody to serve us and we were hungry We finally got some meat and it was fine but then the same thing happened on the next course For the next hour we played this game where the waiters would walk by us doing their best to avoid eye contact and wed try to intercept them Its very hard to avoid concluding that they are really not that keen on giving you meat here which kind of negates the point of being a churrascaria The three sides were all mediocre and unmemorable soggy microwaved bananas mashed potatos and fried polenta wedges For this kind of money Id much rather eat at Ruths Chris or Mortons", "predicted": 0, "actual": 1}, {"input": "went there last night not impressed with their produce dept I have seen a better selection in other stores that do not brag about their farm fresh

American employee into the delisushi area The Asian lady drops the slice back into the container and tells the African American employee to give me the slice The African American man was able to complete the monumental task of reaching in and pulling out the slice of pizza It was an absurd spectacle I think the employees here each have a rigid set of tasks and cant be bothered to do anything outside of their specified set of tasks The African American man was clearly the designated pizza pullerouter but since he was out on a bathroom break or something the pizza area was left to an Asian

would have been nice The men at the bar left and I was 1 of 2 people sitting at the bar And I waited some more Anyway after a little over ten minutes I flagged a woman behind the bar to ask for a menu and was finally acknowledged My glass of wine came out fairly quickly but it took her a long time to ask if I was ready to order even after I was clearly done with the menu The wait for the food wasnt terrible When my wine was about 23 empty the woman who took my order asked if I wanted another glass When I asked her how much longer the food would take She said it would be a while So I ordered another The food came out maybe 5 or 6 minutes later I dont have a problem with waiting for my food if theres a reason But please dont knowingly tell me itll be a while just to sell me another glass of wine Anyway onto the most important part of the night the food I got sushi for my fianc\u00e9 which he ate liked but didnt rave about Ive had the pad thai from here before which Ive always enjoyed and I wanted something new so I tried the Roasted Duck Curry Pretty fantastic My only complaints are that the duck was very dry I asked for brown rice and got white and that the sauce to food ratio was severely lacking If I order a curry I obviously dont want soup which this most certainly was not but Id like to have enough sauce that I can taste a bit in each bite Generally the lack of curry sauce made the whole dish feel dry and a bit boing Still the sauce itself was awesome and the vegetables were cooked perfectly Overall Im on the fence Ive been a waitress for long enough that the lack of decent service can make me never want to return to a restaurant Is a few tablespoons of great curry sauce worth a bad experience I never say never but well have to see", "predicted": 1, "actual":

no That would only apply to work done the same day I was furious 27500 for a total of 30 minutes spent in my home and no work completed I had the mirror removed and had them back to do the repair only to have them come a second time and now inform me that the faucet component that was inside the wall should be replaced So he left and told me that he would include the bill for that day when he came

the details this could have been a great meal The kids ordered cheese enchiladas and chicken enchiladas The salsa verde lacked punch The tomatillos really needed to be roasted longer to give the green sauce more depth The chicken was well cooked but under seasoned and I was frustrated with the the use of mozzarella as the filling for the cheese enchiladas There are some great Mexican melting cheeses that could have vastly improved this dish After another long wait we finally received the bill which totaled 65 before tip for our group of four The meal cost was reasonable but I cant really recommend La Mestiza given the below quality of the food and service I experienced", "predicted": 0, "actual": 1}, {"input": "Well unless you are a gambler prepare for a wait We arrived with tables

exam I told them what prescription I had in each eye Then to check if that prescription had changed the doctor did two count that two tests per eye Ive had glassescontacts for 20 years now and I have

had been seeing Dr Schwartz for a few years and almost every time the going got rough he would resort to either medication increases or stacking another medication on top of the one I was taking at the time instead of entertaining other approaches to treatment Being somebody who is pretty reluctant to take every medication thrown at me this was not a very effective solution for me When I tried to explain that I wasnt comfortable with medication increases or additions he would simply say that we should stop seeing each other as we might not be a good fit for one another This to me was disgraceful as he seemed to just tap out when either I wasnt perfectly willing to take more medication or when the situation was difficult Each appointment was 30 minutes at 180 and never really accomplished much aside from me getting another prescription written The frustrating part is once I finally became stable had a decent amount of time under my belt w the medication and was moving along nicely I called to ask for a refill of my medication but was denied because I didnt make a physical appointment I did not have the money for the appointment and was at that moment out of medication Instead of just working w my pharmacy and refilling my prescription so I could continue to do as I was doing successfully and not have a disruptive period of no medication he denied my
